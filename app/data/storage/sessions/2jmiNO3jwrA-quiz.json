The speaker believes that coding will still be relevant, and that AI will augment human capabilities, rather than replace them [2:25]. This is evident from the speaker's statement that \"humans always remain in the loop\" [2:23].\n\n**Question 2**: What is the Notion Agent, and how does it relate to productivity and AI?
