    "hindi-test-0-30": "[0-5] Newton's First Law: An object remains at rest or in motion unless a force is applied to it.\n\n[10-15] This fundamental principle explains why objects tend to maintain their state of motion, and how forces can change that motion.",
    "hindi-test-18-48": "Here is a summary in 1-2 sentences with a timestamp hint:\n\n[18:00] Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force, also known as the law of inertia.\n\nThis law describes the concept of inertia, which is the resistance of any physical object to change in its velocity.",
    "hindi-test-36-66": "[30-40] Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n[50-60] The law of inertia describes the resistance of physical objects to change in their velocity, while Newton's second law relates force, mass, and acceleration through the formula F = ma.",
    "hindi-test-54-84": "[60-70] Heavier objects require more force to change their velocity due to inertia, as described by Newton's second law (F = ma). [75-84] This concept explains why tasks like pushing a car are more challenging than pushing a bicycle, highlighting the relationship between mass and acceleration.",
    "hindi-test-72-102": "Here's a summary in 1-2 sentences:\n\n**[72-102]**\n\nNewton's laws describe the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration (F=ma), revealing that heavier objects require more force to accelerate them. Additionally, Newton's third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, as seen when pushing a wall results in the wall pushing back with equal force.",
    "hindi-test-90-120": "[90-120 seconds]\n\nHeavier objects require more force to accelerate them due to Newton's first law of motion, which states that force is necessary to overcome inertia. Additionally, Newton's third law explains that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, such as when pushing a wall, resulting in the wall pushing back with equal force.",
    "hindi-test-108-138": "[120] Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, illustrating the fundamental principle of balance in motion and forces.\n\n[130] This concept applies universally, from the mechanics of rockets to the simple interactions between everyday objects like pushing a wall.",
    "hindi-test-126-156": "[140] Newton's laws of motion describe how forces affect an object's motion, governing everything from the trajectory of a rocket to the behavior of everyday objects.\n\n[150] These fundamental principles, particularly in space, enable rockets to propel themselves forward by expelling gases backward, making them crucial for space exploration.",
    "hindi-test-144-174": "[164] According to Newton's laws, rockets propel themselves forward by expelling gases in one direction, while on Earth, friction and air resistance slow down or stop an object's motion.\n\n[168] Without friction, objects would continue moving indefinitely due to inertia, highlighting the importance of friction in slowing down or stopping motion.",
    "hindi-test-162-192": "Here is a summary in 1-2 sentences with a timestamp hint:\n\n**17th-19th century**: Friction and air resistance play crucial roles in shaping motion on Earth, influencing the design of various structures and machines that rely on classical mechanics principles.\n\n(Note: The timestamp hint \"17th-19th century\" corresponds to the time period [162-192] mentioned in your original text.)",
    "hindi-test-180-210": "**[190]**\n\nLaws of motion, specifically Newton's laws, form the basis of classical mechanics, enabling engineers to design vehicles, buildings, and machines while understanding how forces interact with mass and acceleration.\n\n**[200]**\n\nPracticing problems related to these laws helps solidify a deeper comprehension of concepts such as force calculation when mass and acceleration are provided.",
    "hindi-test-198-228": "Here is a summary in 1-2 sentences with a timestamp hint:\n\n[198-228]: Understanding classical mechanics laws helps engineers design vehicles, buildings, and machines by calculating forces when mass and acceleration are given.\n\nNote: The timestamp hint suggests that the video or tutorial starts at year 198 and ends at 228.",
    "hindi-test-216-240": "Here is a summary of the text in 1-2 sentences with a timestamp hint:\n\n[216-240]: Practice problems will help solidify understanding of concepts related to force calculation when mass and acceleration are given.\n\n(Note: The timestamp range [216-240] likely corresponds to a specific video or lesson, but without more context, it's difficult to provide an exact time."
